# Site config builder

This is the code that runs our [site config builder](http://siteconfig.fivefilters.org/) for [Full-Text RSS](http://fivefilters.org/content-only/). 

Our [blog post](http://blog.fivefilters.org/post/89670417277/visual-content-block-selector-for-full-text-rss) will tell you a little more about why this was created.

Note: It's experimental and was put together very quickly. Feel free to change it or improve it.
